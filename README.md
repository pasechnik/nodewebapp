WebApp Starter 
=======================

A boilerplate for **Node.js** web applications.

If you have attended any hackathons in the past, then you know how much time it takes to
get a project started: decide on what to build, pick a programming language, pick a web framework,
pick a CSS framework. A while later, you might have an initial project up on GitHub and only then
can other team members start contributing. Or how about doing something as simple as *Sign in with Facebook*
authentication? You can spend hours on it if you are not familiar with how OAuth 2.0 works.

When I started this project, my primary focus was on **simplicity** and **ease of use**.
I also tried to make it as **generic** and **reusable** as possible to cover most use cases of hackathon web apps,
without being too specific. In the worst case you can use this as a learning guide for your projects,
if for example you are only interested in **Sign in with Google** authentication and nothing else.

Features
--------

- Flash notifications
- MVC Project Structure
- Node.js clusters support
- Sass stylesheets (auto-compiled via middleware)
- Bootstrap 3 + Extra Themes

Prerequisites
-------------

- [Node.js 6.0+](http://nodejs.org)

Getting Started
---------------

The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:

```bash
# Get the latest snapshot
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/pasechnik/nodewebapp.git myproject

# Change directory
cd myproject

# Install NPM dependencies
npm install

node app.js
```

**Note:** I highly recommend installing [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon).
It watches for any changes in your  node.js app and automatically restarts the
server. Once installed, instead of `node app.js` use `nodemon app.js`. It will
save you a lot of time in the long run, because you won't need to manually
restart the server each time you make a small change in code. To install, run
`sudo npm install -g nodemon`.

**Note:** There is no preference how you name or structure your views.
You could place all your templates in a top-level `views` directory without
having a nested folder structure, if that makes things easier for you.
Just don't forget to update `extends ../layout`  and corresponding
`res.render()` paths in controllers.

Recommended Node.js Libraries
-----------------------------

- [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) - Automatically restart Node.js server on code changes.
- [geoip-lite](https://github.com/bluesmoon/node-geoip) - Geolocation coordinates from IP address.
- [Filesize.js](http://filesizejs.com/) - Pretty file sizes, e.g. `filesize(265318); // "265.32 kB"`.
- [Numeral.js](http://numeraljs.com) - Library for formatting and manipulating numbers.
- [Node Inspector](https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector) - Node.js debugger based on Chrome Developer Tools.

Pro Tips
--------

- When installing an NPM package, add a *--save* flag, and it will be automatically
added to `package.json` as well. For example, `npm install --save moment`.
- Use [async.parallel()](https://github.com/caolan/async#parallel) when you need to run multiple
asynchronous tasks, and then render a page, but only when all tasks are completed. For example, you might
want to scrape 3 different websites for some data and render the results in a template
after all 3 websites have been scraped.
- Need to find a specific object inside an Array? Use [_.find](http://lodash.com/docs#find)
function from Lodash. For example, this is how you would retrieve a
Twitter token from database: `var token = _.find(req.user.tokens, { kind: 'twitter' });`,
where 1st parameter is an array, and a 2nd parameter is an object to search for.

FAQ
---

### Why do I get `403 Error: Forbidden` when submitting a form?
You need to add the following hidden input element to your form. This has been
added in the [pull request #40](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter/pull/40)
as part of the CSRF protection.

```
input(type='hidden', name='_csrf', value=_csrf)
```

**Note:** It is now possible to whitelist certain URLs. In other words you can
specify a list of routes that should bypass CSRF verification check.

**Note 2:** To whitelist dynamic URLs use regular expression tests inside the
CSRF middleware to see if `req.originalUrl` matches your desired pattern.

### I get an error when I deploy my app, why?
Chances are you haven't changed the *Database URI* in `.env`. If `MONGODB`/`MONGOLAB_URI` is
set to `localhost`, it will only work on your machine as long as MongoDB is
running. When you deploy to Heroku, OpenShift or some other provider, you will not have MongoDB
running on `localhost`. You need to create an account with [mLab](https://mongolab.com/)
or [Compose](https://www.compose.io/), then create a free tier database.
See [Deployment](#deployment) for more information on how to setup an account
and a new database step-by-step with mLab.

### Why Jade instead of Handlebars?
When I first started this project I didn't have any experience with Handlebars. Since then I have worked on Ember.js apps and got myself familiar with the Handlebars syntax. While it is true Handlebars is easier, because it looks like good old HTML, I have no regrets picking Jade over Handlebars. First off, it's the default template engine in Express, so someone who has built Express apps in the past already knows it. Secondly, I find `extends` and `block` to be indispensable, which as far as I know, Handlebars does not have out of the box. And lastly, subjectively speaking, Jade looks much cleaner and shorter than Handlebars, or any non-HAML style for that matter.

### Why do you have all routes defined in app.js?
For the sake of simplicity. While there might be a better approach,
such as passing `app` context to each controller as outlined in this
[blog](http://timstermatic.github.io/blog/2013/08/17/a-simple-mvc-framework-with-node-and-express/),
I find such style to be confusing for beginners.
It took me a long time to grasp the concept of `exports` and `module.exports`,
let alone having a global `app` reference in other files.
That to me is a backward thinking.
The `app.js` is the "heart of the app", it should be the one referencing
models, routes, controllers, etc.
When working solo on small projects I actually prefer to have everything inside `app.js` as is the case with [this]((https://github.com/sahat/ember-sass-express-starter/blob/master/app.js))
REST API server.

At this point we are done with the back-end.
